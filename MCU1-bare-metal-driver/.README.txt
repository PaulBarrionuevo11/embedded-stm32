Notes

- MCU bus interfaces
If the instructions are present in between the memory locations 0x00000000 to 0x1FFFFFFC then the Cortex processor will fetch the instructions using ICODE interface.
If the instructions are present outside of 0x00000000 to 0x1FFFFFF then processor fetches the instructions over the system bus.
If the data is present in between the memory locations 0x00000000 to 0x1FFFFFF, then processor fetches the data over D-CODE bus interface.
If the data is present outside 0x00000000 to 0x1FFFFFF memory locations then, the data will be fetched over the system bus
